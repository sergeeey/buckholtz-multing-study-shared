## Required before claiming discovery

- [x] Arithmetic verification: Eq.32 holds at 0.17σ (0.0135%)
- [x] Koide falsification: Eq.32 is NOT a Koide extension
- [x] Look-elsewhere audit: rank #1 / 83,160 formulas, p < 2×10⁻⁵
- [x] n=12 degeneracy check: {n=12, τ/e} is specific, not generic (263× gap)
- [ ] Look-elsewhere audit v2: extend search space, empirical p-value < 0.01
- [ ] 4/3 derived from F₄/J₃(O) BEFORE using Eq.32 (not retrofit)
- [ ] α_G mechanism: why gravitational coupling of electron on RHS?
- [ ] At least one blind prediction registered and checked against data
- [ ] Independent physicist reviewed the derivation

## Current status

**STRUCTURAL PEARL CANDIDATE** — not discovery.

## Session 10 Update (2026-06-27)

### Atom A — α_G mechanism
Status: PARTIALLY STRENGTHENED
Findings:
- e→μ replacement everywhere kills the relation by ~23 orders (x7399 gap). m_e is NOT a post-hoc choice.
- α_G(e) = G·m_e²/(ħc) is Dirac 1937 standard definition, not circular.
- m_e appears on BOTH sides of Eq.32 simultaneously (denominator LHS + α_G RHS).
- J₃(O) base-state hypothesis (H2) remains alive — strongest surviving mechanism.
- F₄ Casimir specificity: n=6,8 give nothing for α_EM/α_G; only n=12 (max degree) works.
Open:
- No derivation of α_G from F₄/J₃(O).
- Need Singh 2022 (arXiv:2209.03205) §3 check: does J₃(O) canonically select m_e?

### Atom B — 4/3
Status: STRUCTURAL CLUE, NOT DERIVATION
Findings:
- 4/3 = 36/27 = dim(Spin(9))/dim(J₃(O)) appears inside F₄/B₄ decomposition.
- Multiple F₄ ratios exist (52/36, 52/27, 16/9, 36/27). Selection of 36/27 requires justification.
- Retrofit risk: REDUCED not eliminated.
Open:
- Need independent pre-Eq.32 derivation of 4/3.
- Check Buckholtz preprint §2-3 for S³ / κ²=(n+1)/n=4/3 geometric origin.

### Blind prediction n=8
Status: WEAKLY_CONSISTENT, NOT PROMOTED
Reason:
- Best hit: (6/1)(μ/s)^8 = α_S/α_EM at 0.40% — registered BEFORE scan, hit found AFTER.
- But: 30× weaker than Eq.32, α_S is scale-dependent, m_s has 5% uncertainty > hit precision,
  n=8 has 15 hits in 5% vs 2 for n=12 → NOT pair-specific.
- Useful as negative control demonstrating methodology.

### Overall
Eq.32 remains **STRUCTURAL PEARL CANDIDATE** (not yet DISCOVERY).
Stronger than before: post-hoc objection weakened, 4/3 has structural footing, n=8 weak control done.
Missing: mechanism for α_G, mechanism for 4/3, strong blind prediction.

## Rules

1. Do NOT use Eq.32 as evidence for itself (circular)
2. Any new prediction must be registered BEFORE checking data
3. "Beautiful coincidence" alone does not advance the gate level
4. Blocking atoms: 4/3 retrofit risk + α_G gap — must be resolved, not explained away
