# Changelog

> ℹ️ **HISTORICAL — version-tagged releases stopped at `0.4.0` (2026-06-06);
> flagged 2026-09-14, navigation pass.** The project moved from semantic-version
> releases to a dated, per-experiment evidence trail, so the absence of later
> entries is a change of method, not a gap in work. Roughly three months of
> subsequent work is recorded in `experiments/`, `null_results/`, `docs/`, and
> the commit history instead. This file remains accurate for what it covers.
> For what happened after `0.4.0`: `git log`,
> [`CURRENT_EVIDENCE_STATE.md`](../../CURRENT_EVIDENCE_STATE.md), and
> [`PROGRAM_CLOSEOUT_LEDGER.md`](../../PROGRAM_CLOSEOUT_LEDGER.md).
>
> *Moved from the repository root to `docs/archive/` on 2026-09-14, when
> the root was reduced to live documents only. Its former path was
> `CHANGELOG.md`.*

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-06 — k_A Closure Test + Double Inversion Diagnostic

k_A independence audit, D_required PoC (γ_req≈2.27), and double-inversion diagnostic
(isolines + γ/α grid). **No scientific claims changed**: NOT_VALIDATION / MCMC_BLOCKED preserved.

### Added
- `src/bridge_phi.py`, `src/cluster_schedule.py`, `src/d_required_solver.py`, `src/bridge_gate.py`
- `src/k_a_independent.py` — Press-Schechter + virial k_A(z), CSV baseline, N-body scaffold
- `src/k_a_closure_test.py` — PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE without refit (Arms D_csv / D_eff)
- `src/double_inversion_isoline.py`, `src/double_inversion_grid.py`, `src/double_inversion_plots.py`
- `scripts/poc_d_required_brentq.py`, `notebooks/validate_d_required.ipynb`
- `audit/run_k_a_closure_audit.py`, `audit/run_double_inversion_diagnostic.py`
- `tests/test_k_a_closure.py`, `tests/test_double_inversion.py`
- `docs/98_k_a_closure_author_questions.md`, `docs/99_k_a_closure_report.md`
- `docs/DOUBLE_INVERSION_DIAGNOSTIC.md`, `data/README_nbody_k_a.md`
- Candidate 9 `k_a_independent_closure` in `hmult_algorithm_candidates.py`
- Finding 21–22 in `docs/22_discovery_ledger.md`; TJB section L

### Changed
- `discrete_ode` candidate notes: ODE D-closure → KILLED_EARLY

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-01 — Reference-grade hardening

Engineering + epistemic hardening pass. **No scientific claims changed**: all
`blocked` / `unclear` / `provisional` / `NOT_VALIDATION` markers are preserved,
H_MULT(z) remains blocked, and no outreach/publication is implied.

### Added
- `LICENSE` (MIT, Sergey Kuts).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — CI on Python 3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13: ruff (blocking),
  mypy (advisory), pytest + coverage.
- `docs/WHAT_THIS_REPRODUCES.md` — scope clarification: the audit reproduces an
  AI-service-mediated computation, not Buckholtz physics.
- `tests/test_beta_registry_consistency.py` — cross-registry drift guard (4 invariants).
- `src/deep_bridge_diagnostic_fit.py::safe_h_of_z` — sqrt guard against negative H².
- Regression tests for the silent-NaN fix; source-attribution tests for beta candidates.
- `ai_service_source` field on `BetaDefinition`; coverage config in `pyproject`.

### Fixed
- **Silent NaN**: `fit_unconstrained` / `fit_sign_constrained` no longer feed NaN
  to the least-squares solver when H² < 0 (was 16 `invalid value encountered in
  sqrt` RuntimeWarnings, corrupting the LM/TRF Jacobian update).
- Removed 17 `__pycache__` files erroneously tracked in git.
- `warnings.warn` now passes `stacklevel=2` (ruff B028).
- Repo-wide ruff cleanup (72 fixes: import sort, f-strings, `X | None`, whitespace).

### Changed
- Beta candidates re-framed as **AI-service outputs** (Gemini / ChatGPT), not
  Buckholtz model versions; each now cross-references `beta_provenance.py` (the
  single source of truth). Replaces the tautological beta status test.
- `OUTREACH_TEMPLATE.md` marked **DEPRECATED** (stale beta values; superseded by
  the active correspondence log and `docs/93`).
- Docs truth-synced: test count 62 → 533, coverage TBD → 72%, status reflects
  active collaboration rather than cold "ready for outreach".
- `pyproject` version 0.1.0 → 0.3.0; author set.

### Verified
- 533 tests pass, 12 skipped, 0 failures · coverage 72% · ruff clean.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-29 — Appendix A1 forensic extraction
- Word-level forensic extraction of Appendix A1 Steps 3–7.
- Documented that the H_MULT(z) computational formula is missing (bridge under-specified).
- Confirmed β_d=4.5, β_q=18.0 as fitted (Table A1 caption), not derived.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-27 — MVP
- Initial epistemic audit scaffold: registry, numerology penalty, assumption graph,
  data-anchoring leakage guard, Eq.15 arithmetic reproduction, rosetta stone.
